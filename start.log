Opening UO client data files.
Unable to open UO datafile: C:/spel/Ultima Online/map0.mul
POL.CFG specifies UODataFileRoot as 'C:/spel/Ultima Online/'.  Is this correct?
  The following files must be present in that directory:
      map0.mul
      multi.idx
      multi.mul
      staidx0.mul
      statics0.mul
      tiledata.mul
      verdata.mul    (optional - only if present on client install)
Server Shutdown: initializing random number generator
Execution aborted due to: Error opening UO datafile.
