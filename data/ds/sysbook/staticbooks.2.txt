InS20:the former, phonemesS19:combine into largerS15:words which mayS20:contain full phrasalS12:significanceS14:In the second,S18:prefixing specificS15:phonetic soundsS22:changes the subject ofS17:the sentence intoS22:object, interrogative,S21:addressed individual,S10:or dinner.S20:Agglutination occursS20:whenever four of theS15:same letter areS21:present in a word, inS19:which case, any twoS14:of them may beS19:removed or slurred.S17:Pitch changes theS16:phoneme value ofS21:individual syllables,S15:thus completelyS20:altering what a wordS13:may mean. TheS18:classic example isS13:AktgluthugrotS11:bigglogubuuS22:dargilgaglug lublublubS18:which can mean YouS17:are such a prettyS19:girl, My mother ateS18:your primroses, orS21:Jellyfish nose paintsS12:alms potato,S19:depending on pitch.S19:Orcish poetry oftenS21:relies upon repeatingS18:the same phrase inS22:multiple pitches, evenS14:changing pitchS16:midword. None ofS17:this great art isS13:translatable.S19:The orcish languageS18:uses the followingS23:vowels: ab, ad, ag, aktS22:at, augh, auh, azh, e,S20:i, o, oo, u, uu. TheS20:vowel sound a is notS21:recognized as a vowelS21:and does not exist inS15:their alphabet.S22:The orcish alphabet isS22:best learned using theS13:classic rhymeS14:repeated at 23S18:different pitches:S15:Lugnog ghu blatS12:suggaroglug,S17:Gaghbuu dakdar abS9:highugbo,S14:Gothnogbuim adS15:gilgubbugbuilugS20:Bilgeaugh thurggulg.S18:Translation of theS1: S1: S12:first pitch:S19:Eat food, the firstS13:letter is ab,S17:Kill people, nextS13:letter is ad,S17:I forget the restS20:But augh is in thereS10:somewhere!S17:What follows is aS17:complete phoneticS21:library of the orcishS9:language:S21:ab, ad, ag, akt, alm,S19:at, augh, auh, azh,S22:ba, ba, bag, bar, baz,S15:bid, bilge, bo,S19:bog, bog, brui, bu,S21:buad, bug, bug, buil,S21:buim, bum, buo, buor,S19:buu, ca, car, clog,S18:cro, cuk, cur, da,S21:dagh, dagh, dak, dar,S20:deak, der, dil, dit,S14:dor, dre, dri,S18:dru, du, dud, duf,S19:dug, dug, duh, dun,S21:eag, eg, egg, eichel,S19:ek, ep, ewk, faugh,S19:fid, flu, fog, foo,S19:foz, fruk, fu, fub,S19:fud, fun, fup, fur,S20:gaa, gag, gagh, gan,S19:gar, gh, gha, ghat,S21:ghed, ghig, gho, ghu,S19:gig, gil, gka, glu,S20:glu, glug, gna, gno,S20:gnu, gol, gom, goth,S21:grunt, grut, gu, gub,S20:gub, gug, gug, gugh,S9:guk, guk.

TheseS20:three Principles canS20:be combined in eightS18:ways, which I willS23:call the eight virtues.S17:The eight virtuesS15:which we shouldS22:build our society uponS7:follow.S19:Truth alone becomesS20:Honesty, for withoutS19:honesty between ourS18:people, how can weS21:build the trust whichS21:is needed to maximizeS14:our successes.S18:Love alone becomesS18:compassion, for atS20:some time or anotherS23:all of us will need theS21:compassion of others,S15:and most likelyS18:compassion will beS18:shown to those whoS14:have shown it.S13:Courage aloneS14:becomes Valor,S17:without valor ourS17:people will neverS14:reach into theS17:unknown or to theS20:risky and will neverS8:achieve.S17:Truth tempered byS22:Love gives us Justice,S18:for only in lovingS20:search for the truthS21:can one dispense fairS20:Justice, rather thanS17:create a cold andS15:callous people.S16:Love and CourageS19:gives us Sacrifice,S21:for a people who loveS18:each other will beS15:willing to makeS22:personal sacrifices toS20:help others in need,S1: S17:needed in return.S17:Courage and TruthS20:give us Honor, greatS17:knights know thisS20:well, that chivalricS21:honor can be found byS21:adhering to this codeS21:which one day, may beS16:Combining Truth,S16:Love and CourageS21:suggest the virtue ofS23:Spirituality the virtueS21:that causes one to beS17:introspective, toS17:wonder about onesS23:place in this world andS19:whether one's deedsS21:will be recorded as aS22:gift to the world or aS7:plague.S19:The final Virtue isS21:more complicated. ForS22:the eighth combinationS17:is that devoid ofS22:Truth, Love or CourageS20:which can only existS19:in a state of greatS15:Pride, which ofS22:course is not a virtueS20:at all. Perhaps thisS23:trick of fate is a testS17:to see if one canS21:realize that the trueS17:virtue is that ofS21:Humility. I feel thatS22:the people of MaginciaS24:fail to see this to suchS21:a degree that I wouldS19:not be surprised ifS21:some ill fate awaitedS13:their future.S13:Thus from theS22:infinite possibilitiesS17:which spawned theS19:Three Principles ofS15:Truth, Love andS17:Courage, come theS16:Eight Virtues ofS20:Honesty, Compassion,S15:Valor, Justice,S17:Sacrifice, Honor,S16:Spirituality andS9:Humility.S1: S1: S1:

In thisS20:Inaugural Volume, weS22:present this Verse oftS21:Recited as a LullabyeS20:for sleepy Children.S18:Preface by GuilhemS12:the Scholar,S19:The meaning of thisS18:verse has oft beenS21:discussed in halls ofS20:scholarly sorts, forS14:its mysteriousS19:singsongy melody isS19:oddly disturbing toS18:adult ears, thoughS21:children seem to findS18:it restful as theyS20:sleep. Perhaps it isS20:but the remnant of aS18:longer ballad onceS21:extant, for there areS20:internal indicationsS19:that it once told aS18:longer story aboutS20:ill-fated lovers andS20:a magical experimentS19:gone awry. However,S22:poetic license and theS16:folk process hasS19:distorted the wordsS20:until now the localeS18:of? the tale is noS22:more than in the wind,S21:which while it servesS12:a pleasinglyS21:metaphorical purpose,S19:fails to inform theS23:listener as to any realS7:locale!S19:Another possibilityS20:is that this is someS21:form of creation mythS22:explaining the genesisS14:of the variousS18:humanoid creaturesS19:that roam the landsS22:of? Britannia. It doesS21:not take a stretch ofS18:the imagination toS15:name the middleS22:verse's girl becomes aS18:tree as a possibleS19:explanation for theS18:reaper, for in theS23:area surrounding Minoc,S15:reapers are oftS21:referred to among theS14:lumber jackingS12:community asS17:widowmakers. ThatS22:these creatures are ofS16:arcane origin isS16:assumed, but theS22:verse seems to imply aS20:long ago creator andS16:uses the antiqueS20:magickal terminologyS22:of plaiting strands ofS22:ether that is so oftenS16:found in ancientS19:texts. In addition,S16:the reference toS14:snakehills mayS22:profitably be regardedS20:as a reference to anS21:actual location, suchS18:as perhaps a localS22:term for the Serpent'sS6:Spine.S10:A commonerS22:interpretation is thatS17:like many nurseryS22:rhymes, it is a simpleS22:explanation for death,S16:wherein the windS20:snatches up boys andS19:girls and when theyS22:sleep in order to keepS18:the balance of theS20:world.

Yet 'tis alsoS23:known, albeit only to aS17:few, that certainS22:individuals are unableS21:to traverse the blackS21:moongates that permitS15:travel from oneS21:dimension to another.S18:The noted mage andS18:peer of our realm,S21:Lord Blackthorn, onceS23:told me in conversationS15:that his arcaneS22:research had indicatedS22:that the issue was oneS18:of conservation ofS20:ether. To wit, givenS18:the postulate thatS21:matter within a givenS20:dimension may be butS17:a cros-section ofS20:ethereal matter thatS18:exists in multipleS14:dimensions, itS20:becomes obvious thatS13:said etherealS22:structure cannot enterS19:dimensions in whichS22:it is already present.S10:Imagine anS19:individual (and theS15:Lord BlackthornS22:hinted that he was oneS15:such) who existS20:already in some formS11:in multipleS16:dimensions: saidS20:individual would notS21:be able to cross intoS17:another dimensionS13:because HE ISS14:ALREADY THERE.S19:The implications ofS20:this are staggering,S17:and merit furtherS16:study. 'Tis wellS21:known by theorists inS14:the field thatS16:divisions in theS21:ethereal structure ofS17:an individual areS19:already implicit atS22:the temporal level, asS16:causality forcesS18:divisions upon theS18:ether. This is theS15:basic operatingS18:mechanism by whichS15:white moongatesS20:function, permittingS12:time travel.S21:As time travel is notS13:barred by theS22:presence of an earlierS12:self (thoughS17:encountering saidS22:earlier self can proveS19:arcanely perilous),S18:there must be someS15:rigidity to theS23:ethereal structure thatS13:bars multipleS14:instantiationsS18:of structures fromS18:manifesting withinS17:the same context.S19:If one regards timeS22:and causal bifurcationS21:as a web, perhaps theS19:appropriate analogyS15:for dimensionalS21:matrices is that of aS21:crystalline structureS20:with rigid linkages.S15:The only way inS19:which an individualS12:such as LordS15:Blackthorn, whoS18:exists in multipleS21:dimensional matrices,S22:can cross worlds via aS21:black moongate, wouldS17:be for the entireS21:crystalline structureS19:of the dimension toS19:perfectly match theS21:ethereal resonance ofS15:the destinationS10:dimension.S14:The problem ofS11:why certainS15:individuals areS21:already replicated inS20:multiple crystallineS22:matrices is one that IS19:fail to provide anyS19:schema for in theseS20:poor theories. It isS20:my fondest hope thatS15:someday someoneS18:shall conquer thatS18:thorny problem andS20:enlighten the world.S1: S1:

TheS21:reason for its namingS19:is obscure, but mayS19:have to do with theS19:twisted gray stalksS14:from which theS16:spherical canopyS13:sprouts. 'TisS14:something of aS16:misnomer to termS20:these trunks as theyS15:are spindly andS22:flexible. Spider treesS22:provide a fresh, pineyS23:smell to a room and areS23:therefore often potted.S17:In jungle climes,S19:one finds the bladeS18:plant, whose sharpS18:leaves oft collectS21:water for the thirstyS22:traveler, yet can drawS13:blood easily.S20:The deadliest plant,S17:if you can call aS22:fungus a plant, is theS21:Exploding Red SpottedS21:Toadstool. No patternS23:can be discerned to itsS21:habitats save malice,S10:for merelyS22:approaching results inS22:the cap exploding withS20:powder, noxious gas,S16:and tiny painfulS21:pellets flying in allS11:directions.S19:Unfortunately, 'tisS21:impossible to tell itS14:apart from theS20:Ordinary Red SpottedS22:Toadstool save throughS16:experimentation.S19:Truly odd among theS15:varied flora ofS19:Britannia, however,S20:are those which bearS22:names clearly alien toS17:our tongue. AmongS16:these I name theS19:Tuscany pine (for IS17:have never seen aS20:region of this worldS19:named Tuscany), theS22:o'hii tree, whose veryS21:name sounds like someS21:tropical isle and theS18:welsh poppy, whichS20:while different fromS20:an ordinary poppy inS21:color and appearance,S20:is prefaced with theS15:odd word welsh,S17:which as far as IS19:know means to forgoS14:paying a debt.S1: S1: S1: S1:

First and mostS21:obvious is the amountS18:of damage that theS21:weapon may do againstS18:unprotected flesh.S20:While 'tis this thatS18:first attracts theS23:attention of the noviceS21:'tis a deadly mistakeS19:to regard it as theS23:sole value of a weapon.S18:While it may proveS23:devastating indeed as aS16:means of causingS16:damage, a weaponS18:must also serve asS17:stout shield whenS18:engaged in combat.S16:Hence the secondS21:issue to which to payS23:attention is the amountS20:of protection that aS17:weapon may offer.S22:Pay close attention toS22:the guard on it, if itS18:be a blade, or theS22:stoutness of it's woodS19:if it is a polearm.S22:Oft related to this isS21:the wait of a weapon,S21:for a heavy weapon isS17:more difficult toS17:maneuver to blockS22:with, though it may doS19:more damage to theyS21:opponent. If a weaponS20:is too heavy for theS18:wielder to move itS19:freely, they shouldS22:choose another and notS22:attempt to prove theirS19:prowess by the sizeS15:of their sword.S16:The reach of theS20:weapon both increaseS22:its defensive ability,S19:and renders it moreS21:useful in open spacesS19:as it allows attackS20:against the opponentS19:without the need toS22:close. But be aware ofS22:the limitations of thyS20:weapon! For a weaponS20:with great reach mayS19:be useless in closeS20:quarter, for lack ofS21:space to maneuver it.S11:Should thatS15:dagger-wieldingS19:enemy close on theeS22:and they halberd, 'tisS13:best to flee.S21:Lastly, a factor thatS14:must always beS17:considered is theS16:condition of theS21:weapon. It might be aS16:wondrous magicalS19:blade of surpassingS20:sharpness and it mayS19:leap to block blowsS18:with a mind of itsS21:own. It also might beS14:of such flimsyS16:construction, orS18:damaged to such anS22:extent, that the firstS22:time it clangs againstS21:steel, 'twill shatterS20:into useless shards.S14:Seek ye a goodS17:blacksmith shouldS18:they weapon becomeS21:damaged, but be awareS10:that theirS17:ministrations mayS15:simply make theS13:matter worse.S14:While mages ofS23:some ability oft createS15:magical weaponsS20:which enhance skill,S19:are preternaturallyS20:sharp, or incinerateS17:the enemy as theyS17:fall, to mind theS23:greatest gift that theyS17:can grant a stoutS19:sword is to make itS20:resistant to damage,S22:for they own skill canS11:make up theS18:difference. ExceptS21:for the fireball, butS16:if the corpse isS21:charred, then so willS19:be the possessions,S20:which maketh lootingS10:difficult!S1: S1: S1:

	contents a192:S18:Societies oft haveS15:common codes ofS16:conduct which itS22:expects all its peopleS23:to abide by. Now, whileS23:'tis true that this canS10:offer someS19:advantages, most ofS21:the codes I see todayS21:around Britannia haveS19:fatal flaws. Let usS13:examine them.S15:First, there isS20:Blackthorn's code ofS18:Chaos or basicallyS16:Anarchy. WhereasS16:this affords theS18:individual maximumS15:opportunity forS22:individuality and evenS19:pursuit of personalS22:happiness, it does notS16:offer even basicS21:interpersonal conductS23:codes to prevent peopleS17:from killing eachS6:other.S18:Without such basicS22:tenets, all the peopleS20:will need to spend aS22:significant portion ofS21:their time and effortS16:towards personalS19:protection and thusS17:less time towardsS21:other more beneficialS9:pursuits.S18:Then there are theS23:moral codes that are soS20:popular today. TheseS23:codes are built largelyS23:on historical traditionS19:rather than currentS23:logic and thus are alsoS15:antiquated. ForS18:example many moralS18:codes we see todayS18:include statementsS24:about not eating certainS20:foods that once wereS20:often poisonous, butS21:today can be preparedS7:safely.S11:Many forbidS21:contact between youngS22:people of the oppositeS20:gender, which can inS22:fact be hazardous; butS20:the codes often haveS22:lost the context as toS17:why this is done,S22:instead merely callingS22:it amoral. In this dayS22:and age to call that aS15:necessary moralS16:would need a newS22:reasoning. I put forthS21:that tradition is notS7:enough.S19:Then there are LordS21:British's Virtues. ItS21:strikes me that whileS22:a system of virtues isS14:wonderful as aS21:touchstone to guide aS15:society to goodS19:behavior, these areS17:but shades of theS22:underlying truth as toS19:why one may wish toS24:live a life according toS16:certain rules ofS8:conduct.S18:On the other hand,S19:clearly the VirtuesS22:that I have heard LordS20:British speak of areS22:clearly positive codesS22:of conduct, far betterS17:than the world ofS17:anarchy that LordS20:Blackthorn suggests.S18:Yet, are not theseS21:Virtues still derivedS13:from a set ofS16:principles whichS17:though they soundS22:good, are difficult toS19:pin down as actual,S20:undeniable, rationalS8:truths?,S16:Worse yet thoughS17:imagine a societyS21:who's code of conductS17:was based on pureS15:survival of theS21:strongest. While thisS20:society may functionS19:and even accomplishS22:much, it can be fairlyS20:argued that personalS15:happiness wouldS21:suffer greatly exceptS24:for those at the top. ToS14:rule that out,S16:however, we mustS18:first believe thatS22:people have a right toS17:pursue happiness.S16:I hope is a safeS19:assumption that allS17:beings wish to beS21:happy; I will broadlyS16:describe this asS21:Hedonism. Yet, if allS25:people did is live a lifeS18:of hedonism, theirS20:hedonism might be inS19:conflict with thoseS20:near them, so I willS22:use the term Ethics toS19:describe limits oneS18:might put on one'sS21:hedonistic tendenciesS18:to allow others toS12:pursue theirS18:happiness as well.S16:Allow me to giveS20:this example: If oneS23:were to live alone on aS22:desert isle, one couldS19:live a life of pureS16:hedonism, for noS21:action one might takeS20:could interfere withS18:another's right toS12:pursue theirS21:happiness. Poison theS23:lake if you like, thereS22:is no one to blame butS9:yourself!S18:Now suppose two ofS24:you live on that island.S18:Thou dost not wantS20:thy neighbor to feelS24:free to poison the lake.S22:Would it not be betterS24:to consider it unethicalS18:to poison the lakeS22:without first thinkingS14:of those whoseS20:pursuit of happinessS20:might be affected byS13:this action?,S22:I put forth that it isS21:the fact that we as aS24:people choose to live inS17:groups known as aS22:society that causes usS17:to compromise ourS18:pure hedonism withS1: S22:Likewise we accept notS18:being able to killS22:others without reason,S15:because our ownS20:pursuit of happinessS16:would be greatlyS21:interfered with if weS19:feared others wouldS18:do the same to us.S18:From this basis ofS19:logic can be formedS21:the Tenets of EthicalS9:Hedonism.S16:For more on thisS16:subject, see theS18:Tenants of EthicalS20:Hedonism, by RichardS19:Garriott and HermanS7:Miller.S1:

Once thatS20:fight was underway IS21:was able to make goodS19:my escape.

A chill windS20:entered the room andS19:it seemd a gash wasS21:torn in the very air.S17:Through the gas IS19:could see stars andS18:swirling clouds ofS18:stellar dust and aS19:coldness sucked allS19:the warmth from theS20:air.

AndS22:these are the words itS12:spoke (for IS19:memorized them mostS12:carefully):,S15:Greetings, LordS22:British. I am the TimeS18:Lord, a being fromS11:beyond yourS22:dimension, as thou artS18:from a world otherS18:than Sosaria. I amS18:here to bring theeS18:warning.

IS18:remember, he said.S17:Oft have I wishedS19:that stranger wouldS7:return.S17:He hath returned,S20:spoke the voice. ButS21:not to here. When theS20:Gem was shattered, aS20:thousand shards wereS20:scattered across theS17:dimensions and inS21:each shard there is aS19:perfect likeness ofS20:this world. And thouS18:dost live upon oneS20:such shard, for thouS19:art not of the trueS14:world-thou artS20:merely a reflection.S19:Lord British lookedS20:shaken by this and IS20:did not know what toS21:think! Was I merely aS18:shadow of the realS21:me, which lives stillS14:somewhere elseS16:across uncountedS11:universes?,S18:My task is to healS21:this shattered world,S22:Lord British, said theS20:voice. And I seek toS17:enlist thee in myS21:cause. Be warned thatS21:in this case, healingS17:carries with it aS15:terrible price.S14:Concern warredS20:with curiosity on myS22:liege's face, but everS17:one to shoulder aS10:burden, heS22:straightened and facedS19:the gash in the airS17:bravely. Name thyS6:price.S12:A shard of aS13:universe is aS18:powerful thing andS21:universe shattered isS16:always in dangerS18:from the powers ofS17:darkness. AlreadyS17:three shards wereS23:turned to evil and sentS22:to plague the originalS20:universe in the formS15:of Shadowlords.S17:Many times have IS20:brought the StrangerS21:back to Britannia, toS20:preserve it from itsS17:own folly or fromS20:outside dangers. YetS20:as long as the worldS23:remaineth in pieces, itS21:remaineth vulnerable.S17:We must bring theS20:shards into harmony,S21:so that they resonateS21:in such a manner thatS20:matches the originalS18:universe. Then theS19:two universes shallS21:merge and be again asS4:one.S18:But if we are onlyS15:shadows... LordS12:British saidS12:wonderingly.S18:The light from theS21:stars within the holeS14:seemed to dim.S11:Indeed, theS17:reflections shallS19:become one with theS21:orginal. Thou wouldstS23:cease to be as thou artS22:and become part of theS22:larger you. Thou shaltS17:not die; however,S21:uncounted generationsS21:have passed and borneS19:children since thatS20:day and they have noS18:counterparts.

All ofS13:my people, heS9:breathed.S11:Tis for theS14:greateer good.S18:Lord British bowedS9:his head.S16:'Twas then I sawS19:the movement by theS21:door, half-hid by theS19:heavy red curtains.S21:Lord Blackthron stoodS21:there, concealed fromS21:the rest of the room,S19:his face white. HowS16:long had he beenS19:listening? I cannotS23:say, yet I suspect thatS21:he had heard all thatS20:the mysterious voiceS11:had to say.S17:How then, shall IS14:aid thee?

In theS16:former, phonemesS19:combine into largerS15:words which mayS20:contain full phrasalS20:significance. In theS17:second, prefixingS17:specific phoneticS18:sounds changes theS14:subject of theS21:sentence into object,S14:interrogative,S21:addressed individual,S10:or dinner.S20:Agglutination occursS20:whenever four of theS15:same letter areS21:present in a word, inS19:which case, any twoS14:of them may beS19:removed or slurred.S17:Pitch changes theS16:phoneme value ofS21:individual syllables,S15:thus completelyS20:altering what a wordS13:may mean. TheS18:classic example ifS13:AktgluthugrotS11:bigglogubuuS12:dargilgaglugS19:lublublub which canS19:mean You are such aS15:pretty girl, MyS15:mother ate yourS13:primroses, orS21:Jellyfish nose paintsS22:alms potato, dependingS9:on pitch.S19:Orcish poetry oftenS21:relies upon repeatingS18:the same phrase inS22:multiple pitches, evenS14:changing pitchS16:midword. None ofS17:this great are isS13:translatable.S19:The orcish languageS18:uses the followingS24:vowels: ab, ad, ag, akt,S22:at, augh, auh, azh, e,S20:i, o, oo, u, uu. TheS20:vowel sound a is notS21:recognized as a vowelS21:and does not exist inS19:their alphabet. TheS23:orcish alphabet is bestS17:learned using theS13:classic rhymeS14:repeated at 23S17:different pitchs:S15:Lugnog ghu blatS20:suggaroglug. GaghbuuS19:dakdar ab highugbo,S14:Gothnogbuim adS15:gilgubbugbuilugS19:Bilgeaugh thurggulgS9:stuiggro!S20:A translation of theS12:first pitch:S19:Eat food, the firstS13:letter is ab,S21:Kill people, the nextS12:letter is adS21:I forget the rest ButS16:augh is in thereS10:somewhere!S17:What follows is aS17:complete phoneticS21:library of the orcishS21:language: ab, ad, ag,S19:akt, alm, at, augh,S22:auh, azh, ba, ba, bag,S21:bar, baz, bid, bilge,S23:bo, bog, bog, brui, bu,S21:buad, bug, bug, buil,S21:buim, bum, buo, buor,S24:buu, ca, car, clog, cro,S19:cuk, cur, da, dagh,S21:dagh, dak, dar, deak,S24:der, dil, dit, dor, dre,S23:dri, dru, du, dud, duf,S19:dug, dug, duh, dun,S21:eag, eg, egg, eichel,S24:ek, ep, ewk, faugh, fid,S19:flu, fog, foo, foz,S19:fruk, fu, fub, fud,S19:fun, fup, fur, gaa,S24:gag, gagh, gan, gar, gh,S22:gha, ghat, ghed, ghid,S24:gho, ghu, gig, gil, gka,S20:glu, glu, glug, gna,S19:gno, gnu, gol, gom,S22:goth, grunt, grut, gu,S19:gub, gub, gug, gug,S14:gugh, guk, gukS19:Transcriber's Note:S20:The remainder of theS18:orcish language isS19:not present in thisS17:tome.
