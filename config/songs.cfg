line1	I called on my friend Dupre at his home
line2   I said, Sir Knight, I'm afraid to be alone
line3   I got some weird ideas in my head
line4   About things to do in Minoc when you're dead

line5   I was eating silverleaf the other day
line6   I saw Angrael in the Blue Boar Inn's cafe
line7   Dressed in black, tossing back a shot of rye
line8   Finding things to do in Minoc when you die

line9   A horse and cart won't help you find a priest
line10  Maybe you should find a place to stay
line11  Some place where they never change the sheets
line12  And you just roam around Minoc all day

line13  Dupre says there's something you should know
line14  Not everybody has a place to go
line15  And home is just a place to hang your head
line16  And dream up things to do in Minoc when you're dead

line17  A horse and cart won't help you find a priest
line18  Maybe you should find a place to stay
line19  Some place where they never change the sheets
line20  And you just roam around Minoc all day
line21  You just roam around Minoc all day.

line1   Sometimes

line2   Sometimes we find ourselves
line3   In a situation 
line4   We do not understand.

line5   Sometimes we hope
line6   To find the situation
line7   To be one we want to keep.

line8   Sometimes we begin something
line9   That makes no sense
line10  Yet we appreciate the act.

line11  Sometimes we become
line12  Heartbroken over a situation
line13  That was never expected to begine with.

line14  Sometimes we start to love
line15  Without understanding why or how
line16  Yet we want the love to last.

line17  Sometimes we get confused
line18  By the mixture
line19  Of our thoughts and emotions.

line20  Sometimes we need to ask
line21  How we can sort through this
line22  And keep what we don't understand.

line1   My Love

line2   Shadows, following always.
line3   Accompanying everywhere.
line4   The perfect companion.
line5   Uncomplaining, unasking, undemanding.
line6   Faithful, everlasting, loving.
line7   Always with,
line8   Never behind, never ahead.
line9   Always sharing,
line10  Never taking, never giving.
line11  Together forever,
line12  In perfect union.
line13  Everyone is supposed to have one.
line14  So where is my shadow?

line1  I can see very well.
line2  There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
line3  And I can see it very well.

line4  There's a joke
line5  And I know it very well,
line6  It's one of those that I told you long ago.
line7  Take my word I'm a madman don't you know.

line8  Once the fool
line9  Had a good part
line10 In the play,
line11 If it's so, would I still be here today?
line12 It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way,
line13 They think it's very funny everything I say.
line14 Get a load of him, he's so insane
line15 You'd better get your coat dear
line16 It looks like rain.

line17 We'll come again next Thursday afternoon.
line18 The Inlaws hope they'll see you soon.
line19 But is it in your conscience that you're after
line20 Another glimpse of the Madman Across the Water.

line21  I can see very well.
line22  There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
line23  And I can see it very well.

line24  There's a joke
line25  And I know it very well,
line26  It's one of those that I told you long ago.
line27  Take my word I'm a madman don't you know.

line28 The ground's a long way down but I need more.
line29 Is the nightmare black
line30 Or are the windows painted?
line31 Will they come again next week,
line32 Can my mind really take it?

line33 We'll come again next Thursday afternoon.
line34 The Inlaws hope they'll see you soon.
line35 But is it in you're conscience that you're after
line36 Another glimpse of the Madman Across the Water.
