Removed Nature[NIGHTLEVEL], simplified moons initialization. Preparing to include
the package in the 094 distro.
If you are upgrading from a previous version of nature, remove the nature cprop
from pol.txt.

7/11/01
It no longer repeatedly sends "It begins to rain."

7/07/01
Everything seems to work at the moment. Added differing intensities to the 2.0.0 client
rain code.

7/04/01
Majorly simplified the moons code overall, fixing a few small problems and a problem
that remained in the previous fixes for the moons. Removed the Nature[NIGHTLEVEL]
storage, though the slot for it remains in the array for legacy compatibility purposes.
I haven't tested it yet- that'll be tomorrow. I'm tired. It's 1am and I work tomorrow. 

7/03/01
Implimented a lazier fix for the moons problem, and also fixed a (mostly harmless) race
condition between various Nature scripts that read and write to the same GProp.

7/01/01
Added a seer textcommand: setweather. It takes as its argument an integer, and the next time
the weather changes, it will change by the amount set in setweather.
For example, if the weather is "2" (light overcast) and you ".setweather 2", then the next
time the weather checks to see if it changes it will go to "4" (rain/snow).

I've discovered a bug that is making the moons go out of phase. It's not a big deal, but to
fix it will require a substantial rewrite of the moons script. I'll get to it later in the
week.

6/29/01
Added the config option for resend time.

6/28/01
Made the messages in .lookup more informative and varied.
Weather effects are resent every 2 minutes. Unfortunately, they only last about 30 seconds
on the client. For a while I tried sending it every 30 seconds, and while this was wonderful
as far as seeing constant rain, it also meant getting the "It begins to rain." system message
every 30 seconds, which sucked. And as far as I know, there is no way around it. I may yet
add a toggle- lots of messages vs less weather animation.

6/18/01
Made harsher weather more likely- as it was, it was very very rarely getting beyond "overcast
skies." 
If the weather level doesn't change, rain and snow will be sent to the client again.
Added a toggle for whether or not to broadcast the "It is dawn" type messages.
Added a teleport in place effect before all weather effects (to clear the weather effects).

3/16/01
Added two more cases for the seasons switch in nature.cfg. You may now select no seasons, all
seasons, all but winter, and replacing winter with desolation.
Added a .resetcalendar command, which resets the calendar to 1/1/1.

2/24/01
Created a new function- .desolation. Type ".desolation on" and the world will convert to
Felucca mode and ignore seasons until a GM restores normality by typing ".desolation off".

It appears that seasons are iffy with Ignition. I haven't tracked this down any more absolutely
yet.


2/21/01
Ok, here is a complete list of nature's textcommands:
PLAYER: .lookup - tells the phases of the moons. (To-do: have this return values in the font
that contains the moon phases as characters- font #4)
SEER: .setlocallight [level] [radius] - radius is optional and defaults to 50. Sets the
personal lightlevels for everyone within radius of the seer to the level entered.
      .localthunderstorm [radius] - radius defaults to 50. Causes a thunderstorm around the
seer. 
GM: .setday , .setmonth , .setyear - sets each of these values to the number specified. If
you specify a number greater than the max value it will accept it but the next time it
changes, it will be set to one by the IncrementCalendar function. If you do not send a 
value, send a non-number, or send a number less than 1, it sets it to 1.


2/17/01
Added GM level textcommands that can set the year, day, or month. They are, unimaginatively,
called .setyear, .setday, and .setmonth. Just pass them a number. They will default to 1 if
not passed a number, or if passed a number less than 1.

The arrays.inc file that is bundled with this package needs to be placed in the include 
directory.

Nature.cfg contains two entries, the second of which will hopefully become obsolete. The
first is a toggle for seasons- set to 1 if you want seasons. The second is what client
your server is set up to accept.


2/15/01
It sends weather to all clients, can make use of seasons, and cleans your oven.

You'll need the std.inc available in the POL-scriptforum files section (in the
include folder), and you'll need to comment out or rename the GetTimeofDay
function within it, or within clock.inc. Doesn't matter which- Nature doesn't 
use either one.

If you would like to customize the length of dawn and dusk, the whole day, or the time
between phases of Trammel or Felucca, you will need to edit days.cfg in your config 
directory.
Here, for example, is my days.cfg:

DayConfig WholeDay
{
	Length	60
}
DayConfig Transition
{
	Length  5
}
DayConfig Trammel
{
	Length  60
}
DayConfig Felucca
{
	Length 20
}


If any of those are not present, the scripts will default them to the entries above.

If you have made use of any previous version of the Nature script, you might have to
remove the following GProps from pol.txt in the data/ directory: "Nature" and "Calendar".
Note that doing so will reset your world to day 1, month 1, year 1.


10/5/00
Renamed package Nature. Am rewriting such that: sunny days are more frequent
than overcast ones; Felucca phases every 3 Trammel phases; 3 phases of Felucca occur
within one full day; it keeps track of month, day, year. I'm taking over
maintaining this fork of Raxxla's original (and wonderful) package. 
Also, the weather global array has been converted to make use of consts to make
the scripts more readable.
