// Doors usable from the inside of a multi [no|yes|house|front]
// If "house" is selected, it will vary from house to house and 
//   a script called "innerlock" needs to be placed in the housing
//   package, and must return true if the door can be opened and
//   false if it cannot.
// Defaults to front.

    OpenFromInside	front

// Doors refresh houses [no|yes]
// If "yes" is selected, opening any door in a multi will 
//   trigger the script "refesh" which must be in the housing
//   package.
// Defaults to no.

    DoorsRefresh	yes

// Allowed to close opened locked doors [no|yes]
// If "yes", using a door that is opened and locked will close it
//   whether or not you have the key. If "no", it will act like OSI
//   and tell you the door is locked if you try to close it from outside
//   without the key.
// Defaults to yes.
